checkout GitHub Action [![`Unlicense`d work](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/unlicense/unlicense.org/master/static/favicon.png)](https://unlicense.org/)
======================

Similar to https://github.com/actions/checkout, but

* without Node.js
* can actually fetch any (from a server with needed features enabled) repo, not only GitHub one
* without unneeded for FOSS projects args
* with depth of 50 (like used to be in Travis) by default.
